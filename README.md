# Sketch - Canvas-item-manager

This is a very simple sketch plugin that permits you to automatically show or hide all the items that are not part of an Artboard or a Main Symbol.
This way, you can hide all the element that are not supposed to be visible in your Canvas and leave only your design visible.
